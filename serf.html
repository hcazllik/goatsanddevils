<p class="Poem"><i>for Carina,<br>to destroy habit and boredom</i><br>
  <br>
  The sweaty dog tongue of the sun hung overhead,<br>
  meditating and destroying.<br>
  The serf blinks<br>
  naked on public display.<br>
  He tries to drown it out, but<br>
  the electric noise sears the crowds undone by sound<br>
  a punk ballet.<br>
  <br>
  The knife argues between two sets of hands.<br>
  The tragic poison of the dropper enters his heart as he releases the<br> 
    <span>beast,</span><br>
  forgetting the land, he heads east<br>
  to meet the czar and his golden sands,<br>
  his horses completely boiled, sweet machines,<br> 
  their pistons sagging.<br>
  Strung out deeper than the night,<br>
  Heavier than moonlight.<br>
  <br>
  A shroud of anti-reason<br>
  permeates the season.<br>
  The red teeth of rust cut the blind fog’s eyes.<br>
  Thicker than light;<br>
  it glimpst god once, then dies.<br>
  What is the fog but one enormous ghost?<br>
  <br>
  The white teeth chatter the virus of language,<br>
  and smile in the dark<br>
  where the soldier stands naked and forkless,<br>
  his coughs and sighs<br>
  notes of red noise,<br>
  body covered in the blood of nails<br>
  with flowers in his eyes<br>
  as he gazes into the sun.<br>
  <br>
  Stewing in the moral cement,<br>
  she tried, but the ash tray of his eyes betrayed no thought,<br>
  eyelids, closed coffins in his sleep,<br>
  unholy atoms havoc doth wreak<br>
  death immutable.<br>
  <br>
  The dharma bum wanders the ancient night,<br>
  too cool for karma, dead eyed, sexless in chains.<br>
  Walking the dirty pigeon streets in the angel head husk of dawn<br>
    <span>and dusk,</span><br>
  living like smoke.<br>
  He injects bad stuff into his veins,<br>
  now wherever he goes it rains.<br>
  A jolt of 90-volt nirvana sends him skittering into the museum of<br>
    <span>his skull</span><br>
  where he watches motion pictures forever<br>
  of dog men on invisible leashes walked by giants<br>
  transfixed in super death.<br>
  <br>
  Two lovers stare into each other’s eyes and realize the other is not<br>
    <span>really there,</span><br>
  and two others fall in love over the dust I left behind.<br>
  My love told me a crackling sun means a noisy sunset,<br>
  and that when the clouds are wispy,<br>
  it means the moon must be boiling.<br>
  The all-seeing sky begins to cry with its thousand eyes.<br>
  Pock marks damp the dirt.<br>
  The zombie’s hands multiply,<br>
  and she feels their sensual touch prickling her back.<br>
  It had been a terrible fight.<br>
  Her blood greased the night.<br>
  The dust of rust blows in the wind,<br>
  softly blitz, stunned, glitzed.<br>
  She looks to me,<br>
  then turns to dust.<br>
  <br>
  The sun shoots up above, and beats below the raging waves.<br>
  Plucking nerves made of iron wire,<br>
  he yells<br>
  “I am no man. I am dynamite.”<br>
  He rises in mutiny against rigor,<br>
  in some kind of rabbit starvation,<br>
  some kind of soft-boiled soul cooking dementia…<br>
  He sheds his skin and becomes the beast to escape the pains of<br>
    <span>being a man,</span><br>
  hungry for a primordial soup that can’t be bought in stores,<br>
  best enjoyed ‘neath a full moon.<br>
  <br>
  He split his head open to the universe,<br>
  The pain is only the molting of the shell,<br>
  the threshold the rupture of an optical membrane.<br>
  Utter consumption!<br>
  Absolute power!<br>
  He sees the horse with its flaming blood,<br>
  beyond alive.<br>
  In one hand he holds the salvation of the world.<br>
  In the other, it’s destruction.<br>
  He claps his hands together,<br>
  Liquid sunlight and liquid moonlight immiscible in a bottle shaken:<br>
  200 proof knowledge.<br>
  <br>
  *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*<br>
  <br>
  The ants that march along the palace wall have a claim:<br>
  they’ve seen the inside of the earth<br>
  and it has no gears. No one is driving the Earth.<br>
  Only the sun whose insides we cannot exploit has gears.<br>
  The king hears word.<br>
  You arm yourself with philosophy, and learn bushcraft,<br>
  spend time surviving the wilderness of America.<br>
  Firecrackers in the beard,<br>
  feral enough to kill.<br>
  <br>
  Brave and dead,<br>
  the prisoner tracks the ant’s path along his cell,<br>
  closes his eyes, and sees the cinema.<br>
  The cell disappears.<br>
  Eyes become long hallways,<br>
  warm unstable sausages.<br>
  He casts burning glances at the burning city<br>
  stringing the lyre all dented with joy.<br>
  The ax is ecstatic.<br>
  An ax to the computer lights up its display with broken rainbows.<br>
  I go on stealing for the moon,<br>
  smashing champagne bottles against the ship for good luck.<br>
  <br>
  Take it to the streets.<br>
  Get the shit beaten out of you for love.<br>
  Cut deft as a butterfly,<br>
  its wings slicing starlight,<br>
  your dress contorted by the wind.<br>
  Envy the skyjacks running to get off the ground and the freedoms<br>
    <span>of a burning plane.</span><br>
  Fuck the clock.<br>
  The city is an open canvas.<br>
  <br>
  Forget the richness of the painting…<br>
  its intoxicating, oversaturated colors.<br> 
  It’s all distraction. Far more rare is density.<br>
  Peel the layers back to see it.<br>
  I will tell you a secret:<br>
  the real art is on the backside of the paintings,<br>
  and if there is no art on the backside, then you absolutely must put<br>
    <span>it there,</span><br> 
  in a hotel or bathroom.<br>
  <br>
  Inside your body,<br>
  mirrorless absolute black.<br>
  You are given a box with a smaller box inside it<br>
  detailing instructions on handling the larger box.<br>
  You are perplexed<br>
  so you build a globe.<br>
  The dead are so hip and cool.<br>
  Nothing can touch them.<br>
  <br>
  In a garden,<br>
  the primitives talk<br>
  going for the low hanging fruit,<br>
  which become the explanations of man.<br>
  It tastes like red 40 which stains your insides<br>
  & when you die<br>
  you have a fantastic rainbow autopsy.<br>
  <br>
  The Neon Primitives play the Explanations of Man on radios for<br> 
    <span>millennia,</span><br>
  Snake with Legs perfectly preserved in digital amber.<br>
  See past! His skeleton as a conman.<br>
  You awake in a museum<br>
  shiny and gold, shivering,<br>
  a walking fossil<br>
  metabolized by the regime.<br>
  <br>
  Ants in heaven, humans in hell<br>
  Everything in this country is so boring.<br>
  No one wants to dance.<br>
  Inside earth, ants carve tunnels inscribed<br>
   “complete your mission, then die.”<br>
   <br>
  Setting sail in search of new noise,<br>
  not drunk;<br>
  Possessed by hammered spirits!<br>
  Rolling and rude with something precious to hide,<br>
  secrets heard by ears not permissible should sound like crimes!<br>
  <br>
   “Be wild, be rabid.”<br>
  Having brought<br>
  black ice cream and milk<br>
  to soothe the savage snake,<br>
  the snake hisses:<br>
  “You rejected the image,<br>
  but you still ate the meat.”<br>
  <br>
  *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*<br>
  <br>
  Psychic infections, witch mania, folie a deux…<br>
  Fully automated guerilla technologies scribbled out on napkins<br>
  disguised in breadcrumbs.<br>
  You find yourself in the presence of<br>
  holograms, stage players & self-deluders preparing for the party<br>
  but you don’t yet know they are merely images,<br>
  parodies made of plastic and light<br>
  Televisions— made of millions and millions of little screens,<br>
  Fire casting pure shadow,<br>
  the only 2-dimensional projection in a 3-dimensional universe,<br>
  but your humble prisoner still mistakes it for the real thing.<br>
  <br>
  Wonder eyes equipped with fluid delirium;<br>
  Spring is here.<br>
  The lyre plays itself.<br>
  Rome is still burning.<br>
  Everyone is being transformed into rhinos but I resist,<br>
  hitching a ride on the coattails of the plague.<br>
  You hold the ceremonial vampire fork pulled from behind the<br>
    <span>curtain:</span><br>
  Far too frightening a thing to behold in broad daylight.<br>
  You perform the toast—<br>
  “We hereby honor the heroes<br>
  who were the bad conscience of their time.<br>
  Furtherers of the human spirit who knew how to party.”<br>
  <br>
  When the noise comes, they begin to dance.<br>
  Dangerous black shoes move in every direction at once,<br>
  every image a smeared echo of every other<br>
  faceless behind floating make up.<br>
  <br>
  With the eyes of a wolf,<br>
  hidden beneath my other eyes:<br>
  insane unshatterable pseudo mirrors,<br>
  I look for chickens,<br>
  pupils cracking and blooming,<br>
  a single seed striking fear into the hearts of men<br>
  as a goddamn tree grows from my face.<br>
  <br>
  A hermetically sealed ascetic knows<br>
  the speed of light is most potent in a vacuum.<br>
  Watch as the last train home becomes one long steel band,<br>
  spooky action at a distance.<br>
  Rage and excess,<br>
  love and dissent.<br>
  Burning giraffes spread wildfire through the city like lawless<br>
    <span>candles,</span><br>
  Feral Justice runs on many legs.<br>
  <br>
  You open Pandora’s box simply because you want to look inside,<br>
  but all you see is the all hypnotic vision inducing black box.<br>
  You see the inputs and outputs, but not the inner workings,<br>
  and all around are ghosts only to be seen in the cold<br>
  when their bodies condense, made of pure soul sucked breath.<br>
  Great distance is a time machine.<br>
  The stars are ancient technology moored by sailors and ghosts.<br>
  <br>
  The earth is both a library and the sepulcher.<br>
  SnakeDogs deposit messages in burning waste bins,<br>
  divining smoke language you can breathe.<br>
  It’s the taste of rare perfume.<br>
  You discover an ancient computer<br>
  used to locate astronomical positions<br>
  on a Greek island.<br>
  You use it to track the athletic rituals every four years<br>
  and center driftwood time.<br>
  “How much space is there between each year?” you say.<br>
  “That’s the space between the tree rings.”<br>
  <br>
  *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*<br>
  <br>
  A twilight of iguanas<br>
  making love on one another’s backs.<br>
  Nuptial flowers soft as a deer burst along belly-of-the-snake<br>
    <span>highways.</span><br>
  Bee wings are made of amber,<br>
  the wind is a sleep of ghosts.<br>
  The gentle taste of rarity must be reserved for the rare.<br>
  The air is so dense only the rich can afford to breathe it.<br>
  Anything dusted in snow can be the moon.<br>
  <br>
  Guided by maps of hands holding hands,<br>
  hunting for strangers in the night<br>
  to sew her apathetic God a new heart<br>
  with bloody seams, or a needle of numb in an angry fix.<br>
  It’s snowing in April in your brain,<br>
  but the hypnotic winter has since passed<br>
  so you go out to the woods,<br>
  and if he cuts you the blood is enough to sprout a dozen trees.<br>
  <br>
  Having drank a night of poison,<br>
  you awake in a pile of imitations.<br>
  A live idol kills his false cows.<br>
  Materializations of invisible objects.<br>
  Your shaman has a nice ass so you follow them.<br>
  You parade a burning phallus in the desert.<br>
  40 nights of pleasure,<br>
  40 nights of pain.<br>
  “In a moment, I am human, in a flash I am dust.”<br>
  You adjust your antennae to better receive the transmissions,<br>
    <span>farewell.</span><br>
  <br>
  There are still parts of the moon inside of the Earth.<br>
  The moon dust in the earth dirt turns to mud after everything.<br>
  The sanctuary is closed for repairs.<br>
  In a train with no lights<br>
  you leap into the pool.<br>
  The sound of the train tracks dissolves into your heartbeat.<br>
  <br>
  We move through the midnight highway drives of sleep,<br>
  Contortionists contorting into 2D<br>
  escaping or at least pretending we can escape<br>
  in flesh heat, fucked up, crushed by trophies<br>
  “It won’t hurt after the injection,”<br>
  penetration in deep heaven.<br>
  She blisters over,<br>
  brain made of delicate strands of superfluous moonlight.<br>
  <br>
  The silver spoon of the UFO flies overhead,<br>
  quiet engines of the night.<br>
  He appears to her a spectral stag in darkened woods,<br>
  and she comes to him,<br>
  beckoned on the rack of his budding horn,<br>
  his body a strange fruit filled with seeds and eggs, his eyes inching.<br>
  She shows him all her favorite home movies,<br>
  and a National Geographic of 2 earth worms sharing ten hearts,<br>
  blind jaws moving perpetually, kissing.<br>
  <br>
  A strange animal that perceives time as one frame—<br>
  an overcrowded picture, his brain like a jammed printer<br> 
  making whirring, grinding sounds.<br>
  “What was your life?” he asks <br>
  “Was it everything you wanted?”<br>
  <br>
  Tuning autumn leaves to the proper color,<br>
  the dirt is all detuned.<br>
  How will we ever return?<br>
  Sterile mouths speaking sterile language,<br>
  breath so soft he was afraid he would wake a specter.<br>
  Techno farmer tuning the dirt,<br>
  seeding out the wrong signals<br>
  through the ridges and rainbows of his many salivations.<br>
  <br>
  The candle of humanity is melting,<br>
  You are melting too.<br>
  And as you melt your true form is revealed.<br>
  As life dies you see the machine beneath the flesh<br>
  as with Michelangelo,<br>
  his sculpture already contained within the block<br>
  waiting to be chiseled.<br>
  <br>
  The sculpted noise of music.<br>
  Jagged electric in his veins.<br>
  Mashed potatoes for brains.<br>
  Deconstructed,<br>
  glitz, glitz, he reads her encrypted fingertips<br>
  when they trace his skin,<br>
  and she says that raindrops are the sweetest mosquitos on her skin,<br>
  his skeleton architecturally unsound<br>
  so that his head collapses into his stomach.<br>
  You can feel your heartbeat,<br>
  a stillness like death.<br>
  <br>
  *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*<br>
  <br>
  You’re a time traveler and you are always at the wrong time.<br>
  “Have you forgotten who you are,” he asks no longer remembering <br>
    <span>the man.</span><br>
  “We met at the grocery store,<br>
  Ah yes, you were browsing for meats,<br>
  Whole fountains of pureed meat…<br>
  The image tastes better than the real thing,<br>
  and you are becoming so vapid.<br>
  The ghosts say ‘hi’ as they shop for a body.”<br>
  <br>
  The school cafeteria feeds the children lies,<br>
  it’s hiding in the mystery meat.<br>
  “Come, come,<br>
  The future is all you can eat;<br>
  carnal fruits and pious vegetables<br>
  while the innocent milk curdles into something far more sinister.”<br>
  <br>
  The body returns but the hero does not.<br>
  Fog on wheels shrouds this forest.<br>
  The kamikaze flower blooms once then dies.<br>
  Forgetting the nourishment of<br>
  absurdist promises,<br>
  he finds a truth with bad intent<br>
  better than the invention of a lie.<br>
  <br>
  The fossilized didactics unearthed,<br>
  their great skeletons displayed in churches and glass museums.<br>
  The GMO hooker stands on the corner<br>
  and the great denier sleeps with her,<br>
  an almost fluid banana with which he shares 50% of his DNA<br>
  having moved through so many crosspollinations.<br>
  <br>
  A man chops protesters in half,<br>
  from the stumps of their bodies, trees grow,<br>
  their unbroken remains feeding the roots<br>
  until the he finds himself engulfed in forests immovable.<br>
  <br>
  Dandelions have taken over the little girl’s brain.<br>
  Now she waits for the summer rain.<br>
  When they buried her, the flowers spread into the dirt,<br>
  and the cancer moved from the body into the fields<br>
  where the animals eat their meals.<br>
  It took the animals,<br>
  and the men who ate the animals, and was spread through the<br>
    <span>wind.</span>
  The children sing insane songs<br>
  that fill the hallway with wandering swans.<br>
  The little girl floats on,<br>
  flowers in her eyes as she walks down the aisle.<br>
  <br>
  He builds the wall that unseals his doom.<br>
  Two cockfighting fetuses in a womb come much too soon.<br>
  Two squids in coitus appear like hands clasped lovingly,<br>
  <span>merging</span><br>
  One beast that looks only to itself.<br>
  One beast that worships only within.<br>
  Anyone who follows him he kills.<br>
  <br>
  Blood serf arises from limbs of carnage,<br>
  hair full of smoke, eyes soft as cancer<br>
  headed back into the mountains,<br>
  covered in feudal samurai slaughter.<br>
   “I have the answer.<br>
  I know how to stop the machine.<br>
  Make it stutter!<br>
  Throw a wrench in its gears.<br>
  Obedience and order are smooth.<br>
  Stuttering is the language of resistance!”<br>
  <br>
  Having reached a proper delineated understanding<br>
  the seer proceeds to shove his head in coal,<br>
  scrubbing his eyes clean of vision like lucid dynamite.<br>
  Wisdom is moronic lightning!<br>
  The dead pixels of black flies plastered to his digital eyes,<br>
  lightning headaches skull fuck his brain to butter.<br>
  The cadaver’s bride is in love with the snake,<br>
  the slave obeys the cake.<br>
  A two headed snake leaves no loose ends,<br>
  the camel spits on its masters grave and the meaning is lost.<br>
  He swallows the kill pill.<br>
  <br>
  *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*<br>
  <br>
  Take hold,<br>
  the knife is blood thirsty again<br>
  He staggers<br>
  Gravity’s drunk<br>
  The gears inside his brain are spinning
  The acid is wearing off<br>
  harbinger of death<br>
  The children are being fed through the meat grinder for gold<br>
  All unliberated, blind semen leaking from their eyes<br>
  He looks up to find the music irreparable<br>
  “Stop the machine,” he says<br>
  “Stop the machine”<br>
  “The saintly bard is lost to a dream<br>
  Stop the machine”<br>
  It echoes off the concrete and debris<br>
  Stop the machine<br>
  No rest, sleepless scenery in the ceaseless night<br>
  The lights are full of ecstasy<br>
  Flash, flash<br>
  He hears the bells of death that near<br>
  The stars a million tears<br>
  The wolves crowd closer<br>
  Stop the machine<br>
  Stop the machine<br>
  Stop the machine</p>
<br>
